Unreleased
- Added per-mob `kill-commands:` hook in `mobsconfig.yml`. When a Power Mob dies, an
  optional list of console (or killer) commands runs in order. Each entry supports
  `chance` and an `as: console | player` selector, plus an outer `player-required:`
  flag (default `true`) that skips the block when the mob wasn't killed by a player.
  Commands accept the placeholders `{player}`, `{player_uuid}`, `{world}`, `{x}`,
  `{y}`, `{z}`, `{mob_id}`, and `{mob_name}`. The field is optional; existing
  configs load unchanged. See `bounty-bandit` in `mobsconfig.yml` for an example.

V1.3.1 - 5/19/2026
- Added structure-based spawn conditions for Power Mobs! This includes support for structures
in most datapacks.
- Shifted some UI items in the Spawn Conditions page to include the structure options. 

V1.3.0 - 5/12/2026
- Added Spawn Keys! You can spawn a specific Power Mob or have a list of potential Power Mobs spawn.
Also, you can have dialogue play before a Power Mob spawns through a key with some particle and sound effects.
- Added Spawn key debug option in the config.yml through "debugSpawnKeys:"
- A new spawnkey.use permission is added to allow players to use spawn keys or not.
- Added the option to have a drop ignore the drop range defined on a Power Mob through "ignore-drop-count" in the mobs config.
This is great for if you want a guaranteed drop from a Power Mob!
- Changed the functionality of the "glow" item config to be more accurate to its name. Shows or removes glow regardless of enchantments.
- Added a new item config option of "hide-enchantments" to hide enchantments from an item.
- Changed particle and sound configurations to use their own config subsection for items for clarity.
- Added a new command "/powermob update" to update the item configuration to the current item format.
- Changed item configuration to use the new format through the update command.
- Fixed a bug in the display command for Power Mobs info to actually display the item name instead of the literal object.

Recommended: Regenerate your config.yml, itemsconfig.yml, and mobsconfig.yml to reflect these changes.
Also, run "/powermob update" in-game to update your custom item configuration to the current item format.
Legacy formats will only be supported for a few versions so make sure you keep on top of this.
Let me know if there are any inconsistencies for updating the item configuration. (BACK UP YOUR CONFIG JUST IN CASE)

V1.2.2 - 3/22/2026
- Added customization for the announcement message that is sent when a mob spawns. (Found in config.yml)
- Changed spawn ranges to be bounding boxes. Now you can define multiple ranges for the mob to spawn in!
- Added a new ability: "Switcheroo" - This ability allows a mob to switch places with an attacking or nearby player.

Configs abilitiesconfig.yml, mobsconfig.yml, and config.yml have been updated to reflect these changes upon regeneration. 

V1.2.1 - 2/28/2026
- Fixed a spawn delay bug that made spawn delay calculations using the wrong values.

- Updated default items to fit new requirements and to better represent example use.
